# LLM-Powered Requirements Generator

LLM-Powered Requirements Generator is an AI-driven tool built with Python and Streamlit that helps users automatically generate comprehensive **functional** and **non-functional** software requirements for their projects. This application leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide detailed, high-quality specification drafts suitable for software engineering documentation.

## 🚀 Purpose

The primary goal of this tool is to streamline and simplify the process of writing software requirements, especially for teams that need:

- Structured, standardized specification documents.
- Support for **functional requirements**.
- Support for **non-functional requirements**, including:

  - 🔐 **Security**
  - 🎯 **Usability**
  - ⚡ **Performance**
  - ⚖️ **Regulatory compliance**
  - 🔧 **Maintainability**
  - 🛡️ **Reliability**
  - 📈 **Scalability**
  - 🌍 **Portability**

By providing an intuitive UI and leveraging the intelligence of LLMs, the application reduces manual effort, accelerates the specification process, and ensures higher-quality documentation output.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📋 Guided input forms for capturing project-specific details.
- 🤖 AI-generated requirement drafts, tailored to the context provided by the user.
- 🎨 Streamlit-powered graphical interface for ease of use.
- 📝 Export options to copy or save the generated requirements.
